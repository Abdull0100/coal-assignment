You have to access the branch huzaifa for task 1, file is attempt.py.
Explanation of attempt.py:
There is a main processor class which has all the registers, memory locations and input functions for parsing assembly language instructions one at a time.
All registers have been made into properties and have been stored into a dictionary separating the 16-bit and 8-bit registers.
The registers themselves store data into lists of strings.
The 16 memory locations have been made into a dictionary which stores strings representing the contents of the memory locations.
There is a processor input function called procinput() which takes in all the inputs of the assembly language instructions and displays opcodes (some opcodes might not be displayed).
The following instructions have been defined:
-   MOV
-   ADD
-   SUB
-   INC
-   DEC
-   SHR

GUI can be accessed by main.html in the main branch.

NOTE: Our group was a 3 man group, we did not have the manpower needed to complete this on time, please keep that in mind.
